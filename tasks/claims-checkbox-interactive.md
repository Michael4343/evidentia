# Claims Checkbox Interactive

## Minimal Working Slice
- Manage local state for the two expert request checkboxes so they toggle on user input.
- Update the JSX to remove the disabled behaviour while keeping existing copy/layout.

## Skipped for v0.1
- Persisting checkbox values to Supabase or any backend.
- Enabling the rest of the expert request form controls.
- Styling refinements beyond what's needed for basic interaction.

## Definition of Done
- I can click or keyboard-toggle each checkbox and see it switch between checked/unchecked states.
- The rest of the form remains unchanged and no console errors appear when toggling.
