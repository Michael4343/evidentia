# Add Paper Feedback

## Minimum to prove this works
- Surface a small status row so users see when uploads are loading or failing.

## What we can skip for v0.1
- No toast system, no global state refactor, no animations.

## How we know it's done
- Upload or library errors render a visible, readable message without needing the console.
