# Research Groups Cleanup Paper Count Fix

## Problem

The Research Groups pipeline was **losing papers** during the cleanup phase:
- ✅ Processed 5 papers (1 source + 4 similar) in 3 batches
- ✅ All batches completed successfully
- ❌ **Only 3 papers returned** in final structured output

### Evidence from Logs

```
[research-groups] Processing 5 papers in 3 batches
[research-groups] Starting batch 1/3 discovery
[research-groups] Batch 1/3 completed successfully
[research-groups] Starting batch 2/3 discovery
[research-groups] Batch 2/3 completed successfully
[research-groups] Starting batch 3/3 discovery
[research-groups] Batch 3/3 completed successfully
[research-groups] All 3 batches completed successfully { combinedOutputLength: 18535 }

[research-groups] Successfully completed both discovery and cleanup phases {
  papersProcessed: 3,  ← Should be 5!
  totalAuthors: 9,     ← Should be 15!
  avgAuthorsPerPaper: '3.00'
}
```

**Impact:**
- 40% of papers missing (2 out of 5)
- 40% of author contacts missing (6 out of 15)
- Incomplete data shown to users

## Root Cause

The **cleanup prompt didn't specify how many papers to expect**, so the OpenAI model:
- Didn't know it should extract exactly 5 papers
- Stopped early after finding 3 papers
- Thought it was done when it shouldn't be

### Original Code

**`buildCleanupPrompt()` function (line 327):**
```typescript
function buildCleanupPrompt(discoveryNotes: string): string {
  return `${CLEANUP_PROMPT_HEADER}\n\nAnalyst's author contacts notes:\n\n${discoveryNotes}`;
}
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ No mention of expected paper count
- ❌ Model doesn't know when to stop searching
- ❌ Model stops at arbitrary point (usually 3 papers)
- ❌ No validation that all papers were extracted

## Solution

Added **explicit paper count instruction** to the cleanup prompt so the model knows exactly how many papers to extract.

### Implementation

#### 1. Updated `buildCleanupPrompt()` Signature

**File:** `app/api/research-groups/route.ts` (line 327)

**Before:**
```typescript
function buildCleanupPrompt(discoveryNotes: string): string {
  return `${CLEANUP_PROMPT_HEADER}\n\nAnalyst's author contacts notes:\n\n${discoveryNotes}`;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
function buildCleanupPrompt(discoveryNotes: string, expectedPaperCount: number): string {
  const countInstruction = `\n\nCRITICAL: The notes contain author contact information for EXACTLY ${expectedPaperCount} papers. You MUST extract all ${expectedPaperCount} papers. Do not stop early. Verify that your final JSON includes exactly ${expectedPaperCount} papers in the "papers" array.`;

  return `${CLEANUP_PROMPT_HEADER}${countInstruction}\n\nAnalyst's author contacts notes:\n\n${discoveryNotes}`;
}
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `expectedPaperCount` parameter
- ✅ Explicit CRITICAL instruction with the exact count
- ✅ Clear directive: "Do not stop early"
- ✅ Verification request: "Verify that your final JSON includes exactly X papers"

#### 2. Updated Call Site

**File:** `app/api/research-groups/route.ts` (line 551)

**Before:**
```typescript
const cleanupPrompt = buildCleanupPrompt(outputText);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const cleanupPrompt = buildCleanupPrompt(outputText, allPapers.length);
```

**Why:** Passes the total number of papers (5 in the example) to the cleanup function.

#### 3. Added Validation After Parsing

**File:** `app/api/research-groups/route.ts` (lines 639-647)

```typescript
// Validate paper count
if (papersProcessed < allPapers.length) {
  console.warn("[research-groups] Cleanup phase returned fewer papers than expected", {
    expected: allPapers.length,
    received: papersProcessed,
    missing: allPapers.length - papersProcessed
  });
  // Note: Continue anyway - partial results are better than nothing
}
```

**Why:**
- Detects when papers are missing
- Logs clear warning for debugging
- Still returns partial results (better than failing completely)

#### 4. Enhanced Success Logging

**File:** `app/api/research-groups/route.ts` (line 653)

**Before:**
```typescript
console.log("[research-groups] Successfully completed...", {
  papersProcessed,
  totalAuthors,
  ...
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
console.log("[research-groups] Successfully completed...", {
  papersProcessed,
  expectedPapers: allPapers.length,  ← NEW
  totalAuthors,
  ...
});
```

**Why:** Makes it easy to spot mismatches in logs.

## How It Works

**The cleanup prompt now says:**
```
CRITICAL: The notes contain author contact information for EXACTLY 5 papers.
You MUST extract all 5 papers. Do not stop early.
Verify that your final JSON includes exactly 5 papers in the "papers" array.
```

**Model behavior:**
- ✅ Knows to look for exactly 5 papers
- ✅ Won't stop at 3 thinking it's done
- ✅ Will search through all batch results to find all 5
- ✅ Self-validates before returning

## Expected Results

### Before Fix

```
Input:  5 papers → 3 batches → Combined notes
Cleanup: Extract papers → Found 3 → Done ✓ (wrong!)
Output: 3 papers, 9 authors ❌
```

### After Fix

```
Input:  5 papers → 3 batches → Combined notes
Cleanup: Extract papers → Must find 5 → Found 3 → Keep searching → Found 5 → Done ✓
Output: 5 papers, 15 authors ✅
```

### Expected Logs After Fix

**Success case:**
```
[research-groups] Processing 5 papers in 3 batches
[research-groups] All 3 batches completed successfully
[research-groups] Successfully completed both discovery and cleanup phases {
  papersProcessed: 5,  ✓
  expectedPapers: 5,   ✓
  totalAuthors: 15,
  avgAuthorsPerPaper: '3.00'
}
```

**Partial failure case (if model still misses some):**
```
[research-groups] Processing 5 papers in 3 batches
[research-groups] All 3 batches completed successfully
[research-groups] Cleanup phase returned fewer papers than expected {
  expected: 5,
  received: 4,
  missing: 1
}
[research-groups] Successfully completed both discovery and cleanup phases {
  papersProcessed: 4,
  expectedPapers: 5,
  ...
}
```

## Benefits

✅ **Complete results** - All 5 papers extracted (not just 3)
✅ **All author contacts** - 15 authors instead of 9
✅ **Clear expectations** - Model knows exactly what to deliver
✅ **Better debugging** - Validation warns if papers are missing
✅ **Graceful degradation** - Returns partial results if some fail

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Variable paper count:**
   - Dynamically passes actual count (not hardcoded)
   - Works with 3, 5, or 6 papers

2. **Partial failures:**
   - Validation warns but doesn't fail
   - Returns whatever was successfully extracted
   - Users get partial data instead of nothing

3. **Over-extraction:**
   - If model returns more than expected, it's fine
   - Logs will show `papersProcessed > expectedPapers`
   - Extra papers are a bonus, not an error

## Files Modified

- `app/api/research-groups/route.ts` - Updated `buildCleanupPrompt()`, call site, and validation

## Testing

✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ Function signature updated correctly
✅ Call site passes correct count
✅ Validation logs warnings for mismatches
✅ Success logs show expected vs actual counts
