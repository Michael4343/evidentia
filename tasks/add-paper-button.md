# Add Paper Button

## Minimum to prove this works
- Clicking `Add paper` should switch the reader pane into the existing upload dropzone view.

## What we can skip for v0.1
- No new routes or modals.
- Skip any animation or UX polish beyond the state swap.

## How we know it's done
- From any reader state, clicking `Add paper` hides the current PDF and shows the upload dropzone with no console errors.
