# Sidebar Debug Plan

## Goal
Understand why the reader sidebar is not visible locally and outline steps to surface it if needed.

## Steps
1. Inspect router/layout files to confirm where `ReaderSidebar` is rendered.
2. Manually verify which routes mount that layout and whether `/` should show the sidebar.
3. Summarize findings and recommend navigation steps or code adjustments if necessary.
