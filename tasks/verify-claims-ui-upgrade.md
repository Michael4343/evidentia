# Verify Claims UI Upgrade Plan

## Minimal Viable Outcome
- Refine the JSON cleanup prompt in the verify claims mock UI so it better communicates requirements while staying concise.
- Refresh the verify claims mock UI layout to match the cleaner patterns used in other mock pages (e.g. spacing, typography, CTA clarity).

## Skipped for v0.1
- No real data wiring or API calls; remain on mock data.
- No new component abstractions unless repetition becomes obvious.
- No extensive error handling or loading states beyond what the mock already has.

## Definition of Done
- Mock renders with updated copy and layout comparable to other polished mock pages.
- JSON cleanup prompt reflects clarified instructions and previewed data matches expectations.
- Manual check in browser confirms layout, spacing, and interactions look intentional without console errors.

## Task Steps
1. Review existing verify claims mock implementation and gather UI references from other mock pages.
2. Draft improved prompt copy and identify layout tweaks (e.g. grouping, typography, button styles).
3. Implement updates in the mock UI, testing locally for visual polish and copy clarity.
