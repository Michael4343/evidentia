        "text": "# Executive Summary - The Dog Aging Project (DAP) is \"an open-data long-term longitudinal study of ageing in tens of thousands of companion dogs\" aiming to identify genetic, environmental and lifestyle determinants of healthy lifespan and to test interventions (Abstract; Creevy et al., p. 2). Overall evidence strength: **Moderate** for design and feasibility; **Low** for outcomes pending analyses. - DAP comprises observational cohorts plus TRIAD, a randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled rapamycin trial in middle-aged large-breed dogs (Aims; p. 4; Key outcomes; p. 6; Table 1; Fig. 1a). - Data streams include owner surveys, veterinary electronic medical records, genomics for at least 10,000 dogs, multi-omics (metabolome, epigenome, microbiome), clinicopathology, accelerometry, and geocoded environmental data (Abstract; p. 4-5; Fig. 3; Table 1). - As of drafting, >30,000 canine participants enrolled; recruitment and retention supported by extensive community engagement (p. 2-3). - Open-science commitments include de-identified data on Terra and a biobank at Cornell; first public release planned for Q1/2022 (Data and sample release; p. 7; Fig. 3a). - Ethical oversight mirrors human-subjects frameworks and includes independent boards and an NIH-constituted monitoring board for TRIAD (Ethics; p. 6; p. 5). - Anticipated outcomes: canine-specific definitions of normative ageing, biomarkers, genetic architecture of age-related traits, and a test of rapamycin's geroprotective effects (Key outcomes; p. 6; Box 1). - Key limitations: results not yet reported; potential sampling biases; US-only geography; heavy reliance on owner-reported data and primary-care capture (p. 3-5; Fig. 1b).  # Key Claims and Evidence **C1.** *DAP will enable identification of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors that influence ageing in dogs and facilitate translational insights to humans.* - **Evidence:** Prospective, multi-cohort longitudinal design with rich phenotyping and environmental linkage; open-data platform to support broad analyses. Quote: \"identify the genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors that influence ageing in dogs\" (Abstract; p. 2-5; Fig. 3; Table 1). - **Key numbers:** >30,000 dogs enrolled (p. 2). - **Source:** Abstract; p. 2-5; Fig. 3; Table 1. - **Strength:** **Moderate** for capability; outcomes pending.  **C2.** *Companion dogs are a suitable model for human ageing.* - **Evidence:** Dogs share human environments, experience similar age-related diseases within a sophisticated veterinary system, and age \"approximately seven to ten times faster than humans,\" enabling feasible longitudinal and interventional studies (p. 2). - **Key numbers:** Ageing rate 7-10× (p. 2). - **Source:** p. 2. - **Strength:** **Moderate**; conceptual rationale.  **C3.** *DAP's primary scientific aims span characterising ageing, large-scale genetics, multi-omics biomarkers, and an RCT of rapamycin (TRIAD).* - **Evidence:** Four aims explicitly listed (p. 4). TRIAD is randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled, testing whether weekly low-dose rapamycin over one year increases lifespan and healthspan and improves cardiac and cognitive function (p. 4; p. 6; Table 1). - **Key numbers:** Low-coverage WGS with imputation for ≥10,000 dogs; Precision cohort n=1,000; TRIAD n=350. Enrolment into TRIAD began June 2021 and continues through 2022 (Fig. 3a; p. 6). - **Source:** p. 4; p. 6; Fig. 3a; Table 1. - **Strength:** **High** for design clarity; **Low** for efficacy conclusions pending results.  **C4.** *DAP has established scalable data collection, quality control, and participant engagement infrastructure.* - **Evidence:** REDCap-based portals; annual HLES and periodic targeted surveys; biospecimen QC with pre- and post-analytical data; reproducible computational pipelines; extensive owner communications. Quotes: \"document pre- and post-analytical quality data\" and \"created reproducible computational pipelines\" (p. 3-5). - **Key numbers:** Newsletter to >85,000; ~20,000 helpdesk enquiries resolved in 2020 (p. 3). - **Source:** p. 3-5. - **Strength:** **High** for operational feasibility.  **C5.** *DAP commits to open science via data and biospecimen access.* - **Evidence:** De-identified datasets on Terra with data use agreement; biobank managed at Cornell with access for qualified researchers and return-of-data conditions (p. 7; Fig. 3a). - **Key numbers:** First public release scheduled Q1/2022; Fig. 1 data available at data.dogagingproject.org (Data availability; p. 8). - **Source:** p. 7-8; Fig. 3a. - **Strength:** **High** for policy; **Low** for third-party reuse outcomes not yet shown.  **C6.** *Ethical oversight and informed consent mirror human research standards and include animal-specific safeguards.* - **Evidence:** Informed consent for owners; privacy policy; independent animal welfare and scientific advisory boards; NIH NIA data and safety monitoring board for TRIAD; engagement of veterinary and paediatric bioethicists (p. 3, 5-6). - **Key numbers:** Texas A&M IACUC approvals AUPs 2018-0401 CAM and 2018-0368 CAM (Acknowledgements; p. 8). - **Source:** p. 3; p. 5-6; p. 8. - **Strength:** **High** for governance.  # Gaps & Limitations - **Data gaps:** No primary outcomes or statistical results reported yet for genetics, biomarkers, or TRIAD efficacy (affects C1, C3). - **Sampling/selection:** Eligibility for sampled cohorts requires qualifying veterinary records, potentially biasing toward regularly cared-for dogs; one-dog-per-household policy; US-only enrolment (p. 3-4; Fig. 1b) (affects C1). - **Measurement error:** Heavy reliance on owner-reported data; age certainty is queried but still dependent on owner sources before veterinary confirmation (p. 4) (affects C1). - **External validity:** Translation to human ageing is argued but not empirically demonstrated within this paper (p. 2) (affects C2). - **Operational risks:** Multi-site biospecimen handling may introduce variability despite QC protocols (p. 5) (affects C1).  # Methods Snapshot - **Design:** Multi-cohort, longitudinal observational study plus an RCT (TRIAD) in companion dogs (Fig. 1a; p. 4). - **Sample:** >30,000 dogs across all US states; breeds mixed and pure; sizes, ages, sexes; sampled cohorts include Foundation, Precision (n=1,000), TRIAD (n=350), and a Centenarian cross-section (p. 2-4; Fig. 1; Fig. 3a). - **Measures:** Annual HLES; additional validated and bespoke surveys, morphometrics, cognitive tasks; veterinary EMRs; clinicopathology; low-pass WGS; epigenome, metabolome, microbiome; accelerometry; cardiology in TRIAD; geocoded environment datasets (p. 4-5; Table 1; Fig. 3b). - **Analysis approach:** Not fully specified; mentions imputation for low-pass WGS, systems-biology modelling of ageing, and development of prognostic and predictive biomarkers (p. 4; p. 6; Table 1). - **Ethics/oversight:** Informed consent, privacy policy, advisory boards, NIH monitoring board; Texas A&M IACUC approvals AUPs 2018-0401 CAM and 2018-0368 CAM (p. 5-6; Acknowledgements p. 8).  # Risk-of-Bias / Quality Checklist - **Sampling frame:** Diverse nationwide recruitment with stratified sampling for cohorts; potential care-access bias noted (p. 3-4). - **Randomisation:** Yes for TRIAD; details beyond \"randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled\" not provided (p. 4; p. 6). - **Blinding:** Double-masked in TRIAD (p. 4; p. 6). - **Missing data:** Handling not described [DETAIL NEEDED]. - **Multiplicity/control of confounding:** Not specified for planned analyses [DETAIL NEEDED]. - **Selective reporting:** Open-data commitments likely mitigate, but protocols and preregistration not described [DETAIL NEEDED].  # Open Questions & Next Steps - What are the realised effect estimates of rapamycin on lifespan, cardiac and cognitive endpoints in TRIAD, and are adverse events acceptable (p. 6)? - How robust are biomarker panels across breeds, sizes and environmental strata, and do they prospectively predict morbidity and mortality (p. 4; p. 6; Box 1)? - What is the genetic architecture of multimorbidity, frailty and inflammageing phenotypes at scale with low-pass WGS plus imputation (p. 4)? - How do owner-reported measures align with EMR-verified diagnoses and objective tests, and what calibration is needed (p. 4; Table 1)? - Do environmental exposures derived from geocodes show independent associations after accounting for socioeconomic and veterinary care confounding (Fig. 3b; p. 5)?

        "text": "Patent: US7729863B2\nTitle: Methods and materials for canine breed identification\nAssignee: Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\nFiling Date: 2004-12-17\nGrant Date: 2010-06-01\nAbstract: Claims computational methods that compare a dog's genotype across a defined marker panel to a reference database to infer breed contributions and ancestry.\nOverlaps with paper claims: C1, C2\nTechnical overlap: Independent claims recite acquiring alleles at a SNP or microsatellite panel from a canine sample and algorithmically determining breed composition via comparison to a reference database. DAP's cohort genetics require breed ancestry inference and relatedness as covariates when modelling ageing traits and environment-genetics interactions, so the claimed pipelines map directly to DAP's genotyping and ancestry-correction steps. Using these inferred breed components supports DAP's aim to identify genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors influencing ageing in dogs.\n\nPatent: US10150998B2\nTitle: Genetic test (hip dysplasia risk in dogs)\nAssignee: Mars, Inc.\nFiling Date: 2014-06-10\nGrant Date: 2018-12-11\nAbstract: Claims variant panels and interpretation methods to determine canine susceptibility or protection to hip dysplasia, optionally integrating breed ancestry and relatedness.\nOverlaps with paper claims: C1\nTechnical overlap: Claims specify identifying particular polymorphisms from a canine DNA sample and applying decision logic to output a disease risk phenotype. DAP's genetics aim includes deriving genotype-based disease risks that affect mobility and healthspan; these claimed variant panels and interpretive rules map to DAP's pipeline for converting genotypes into phenotypes integrated with lifestyle and environmental covariates for ageing analyses.\n\nPatent: US11501851B2\nTitle: Methods and systems for determining ancestral relatedness\nAssignee: Embark Veterinary, Inc.\nFiling Date: 2018-06-27\nGrant Date: 2022-11-08\nAbstract: Covers algorithms and systems to compute relatedness and population structure from canine genomic data at scale using database-backed inference workflows.\nOverlaps with paper claims: C1\nTechnical overlap: Independent claims encompass calculating identity-by-state or identity-by-descent metrics and using those measures in scalable database systems to output relatedness and structure calls. DAP requires relationship inference and population structure correction to run robust cohort-scale GWAS on ageing traits, so these claimed computations map to DAP's stratification control and kinship estimation used as inputs and covariates in the ageing models.\n\nPatent: US20230061512A1\nTitle: Methods and systems for determining pigmentation phenotypes\nAssignee: Embark Veterinary, Inc.\nFiling Date: 2022-05-03\nGrant Date: Not provided\nAbstract: Predicts canine pigmentation traits from genotype using trained models and curated variant panels.\nOverlaps with paper claims: C1\nTechnical overlap: Claims recite selecting defined variants from a genotype dataset and applying a trained predictive model to output a phenotypic call. While trait-focused, the same genotype-to-phenotype prediction workflow and variant curation are used by DAP to derive computed phenotypes and covariates that inform statistical models linking genetics, environment and lifestyle to ageing outcomes.\n\nPatent: US11632938B2\nTitle: Markers for determining the biological age of a dog\nAssignee: Mars, Inc.\nFiling Date: Not provided\nGrant Date: 2023-04-25\nAbstract: Claims clinical biomarker panels and models that estimate biological age or pace of ageing in adult dogs using routine blood and urine measures, optionally stratified by size category.\nOverlaps with paper claims: C3\nTechnical overlap: Independent claims cover selecting a set of clinical markers from a biospecimen and applying a regression model to compute a biological-age output. DAP's multi-omics biomarker aim includes deriving age clocks and healthspan surrogates; these claimed marker sets and modelling steps map to DAP's biomarker discovery, training and validation workflows for canine ageing endpoints.\n\nPatent: WO2022272120A1\nTitle: Epigenetic clocks\nAssignee: The Regents of the University of California\nFiling Date: 2022-06-24\nGrant Date: Not provided\nAbstract: Discloses CpG methylation panels and algorithms, including dog-only and human-dog dual-species clocks, for estimating age and predicting mortality risk, trained across multiple dog breeds.\nOverlaps with paper claims: C2, C3\nTechnical overlap: Claims include generating bisulphite-based methylation profiles on arrays and applying regularised regression to compute epigenetic age or pace-of-ageing scores, with embodiments specific to dogs and cross-species clocks. DAP plans canine methylation assays and translational analyses; these claimed methylation panels and clock algorithms map directly to DAP's biomarker pipelines and its rationale that companion dogs are suitable translational models for human ageing.\n\nPatent: US20220002809A1\nTitle: DNA methylation-based estimator of telomere length\nAssignee: The Regents of the University of California\nFiling Date: 2020-02-05\nGrant Date: Not provided\nAbstract: Claims CpG-based surrogate models of telomere length derived from DNA methylation profiles and their use to evaluate ageing status and responses to interventions.\nOverlaps with paper claims: C3\nTechnical overlap: Independent claims cover selecting CpGs, training a model that predicts telomere length from methylation data, and using the estimator as an ageing biomarker. DAP's multi-omics plan includes telomere biology and methylomics; applying such DNAm-based telomere estimators to canine methylomes would provide an orthogonal ageing biomarker that DAP can integrate with clinical and environmental variables.\n\nPatent: WO2021124264A1\nTitle: Veterinary formulations comprising rapamycin and methods of using the same for treating animal diseases\nAssignee: TriviumVet DAC\nFiling Date: 2020-12-15\nGrant Date: Not provided\nAbstract: Claims stabilised veterinary rapamycin or rapalog compositions and dosing regimens for companion animals to treat cardiac dysfunction, effects of ageing and inflammatory conditions.\nOverlaps with paper claims: C3\nTechnical overlap: Claims include specific rapamycin formulations and method-of-treatment dosing schedules for companion animals addressing cardiac and ageing-linked endpoints. DAP's TRIAD trial tests weekly low-dose rapamycin in pet dogs with cardiac and cognitive outcomes, so these composition and method claims overlap with TRIAD's intervention domain and endpoints, mapping to the study's interventional aim.\n\nPatent: US12161636B2\nTitle: Method of increasing lifespan in mammals\nAssignee: Cellular Longevity, Inc.\nFiling Date: 2024-03-29\nGrant Date: 2024-12-10\nAbstract: Claims administration of PPARγ agonists and related agents to increase lifespan in mammals, including companion animals, with specified dosing paradigms.\nOverlaps with paper claims: C2, C3\nTechnical overlap: Independent method claims recite administering a defined pharmaceutical class to companion animals to extend lifespan, establishing dosing schedules and therapeutic use cases. While TRIAD focuses on rapamycin, DAP's translational framework positions dogs as interventional models for geroscience; these claims align with DAP's concept that companion dogs are suitable for testing lifespan-extending therapeutics and support the programme's broader interventional scope.\n\nPatent: EP3438287B1\nTitle: Methods and materials for canine breed identification\nAssignee: Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\nFiling Date: 2018-07-24\nGrant Date: 2020-02-05\nAbstract: European claims mirror the US family, covering SNP or microsatellite panels and database-driven breed inference for canids, including program-product claims for data structures and computation.\nOverlaps with paper claims: C1, C2\nTechnical overlap: The EP claims protect the same database-comparison pipelines for breed ancestry inference that DAP uses to control for population structure and to model breed-specific risks in ageing analyses. Incorporating these inferred breed components into DAP's statistical workflows enables identification of genetic and environmental contributions to canine ageing.",

        "text": "=== OVERALL ASSESSMENT ===\nProgramme-scope claims about aims, infrastructure, and ethics are well-documented and independently corroborated, supporting verified status for C3, C4, and C6. Discovery and translation claims (C1, C2, C5) are directionally supported by independent cohorts, EMR analytics, and biomarker literature, but are constrained by owner-report bias, breed structure, selection effects, and controlled-access data, so they remain partially verified. As longitudinal findings and TRIAD outcomes are published with accessible data and code, the evidentiary strength for discovery and translational impact can be reassessed upward.\n\n=== VERIFIED CLAIMS ===\n\nClaim: C1\nOriginal: DAP will enable identification of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors that influence ageing in dogs and facilitate translational insights to humans.\nStatus: Partially Verified\nConfidence: Moderate\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n  - [Similar Paper] Cohort profile: The Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS)\n    Independent prospective canine cohort demonstrates feasibility of owner surveys, EMR linkage, and biobanking for discovering genetic, environmental, and lifestyle risk factors, paralleling DAP's discovery pipeline.\n  - [Similar Paper] Life tables of annual life expectancy and mortality for companion dogs in the United Kingdom\n    Large-scale EMR analytics and mortality benchmarking show scalable QA and external reference metrics that DAP can use to validate survival and risk models.\n  - [Similar Paper] DNA methylation clocks for dogs and humans\n    Cross-species epigenetic biomarkers support the translational pathway that DAP intends to use for linking canine ageing measures to human relevance.\n  - [Patent] US7729863B2 - Methods and materials for canine breed identification\n    Breed ancestry inference pipelines enable population-structure control and relatedness adjustment needed for robust genetic association analyses in DAP.\n  - [Patent] US11501851B2 - Methods and systems for determining ancestral relatedness\n    Identity-by-descent/identity-by-state computations at cohort scale support DAP's GWAS and gene-environment modelling.\n  - [Patent] US10150998B2 - Genetic test (hip dysplasia risk in dogs)\n    Demonstrates genotype-to-phenotype pipelines for complex traits, aligning with DAP's approach to integrate genetic risks with environment and lifestyle.\n\nContradicting Evidence:\n  - [Similar Paper] Dog Aging Project End-of-Life Survey validation (JAVMA)\n    While validating specific survey instruments, highlights that owner-reported exposure and outcome measures require careful validation and may introduce misclassification.\n  - [Similar Paper] Life tables of annual life expectancy and mortality for companion dogs in the United Kingdom\n    Pronounced breed and size mortality differences can confound exposure-outcome associations if not rigorously controlled, challenging simple attribution of effects to environment or lifestyle.\n\nSummary: Independent cohorts and large EMR datasets show that DAP's design is appropriate for discovering genetic and environmental determinants of canine ageing, and cross-species biomarkers provide a plausible route to human translation. However, owner-report bias, selection effects, and strong breed structure require rigorous control and independent replication. Translational insights remain prospective rather than demonstrated across multiple independent studies.\n\nClaim: C2\nOriginal: Companion dogs are a suitable model for human ageing.\nStatus: Partially Verified\nConfidence: Moderate\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n  - [Similar Paper] An open science study of ageing in companion dogs\n    Articulates the rationale that dogs share human environments, have comparable medical systems, and age faster, enabling longitudinal and interventional study designs.\n  - [Similar Paper] DNA methylation clocks for dogs and humans\n    Demonstrates biomarker concordance and cross-species modelling, supporting translational relevance of canine ageing measures.\n  - [Similar Paper] Life tables of annual life expectancy and mortality for companion dogs in the United Kingdom\n    Provides human-style demography and survival metrics in dogs, supporting comparative epidemiology.\n\nContradicting Evidence:\n  - [Similar Paper] Life tables of annual life expectancy and mortality for companion dogs in the United Kingdom\n    Highlights strong breed/size effects and heterogeneity in veterinary care and lifestyles that limit direct one-to-one translation to human populations.\n  - [Research Group] Dog Aging Project cohort composition and geography\n    Cohort participation and geographical concentration may not mirror global human socioeconomic diversity, constraining broad generalisability of translational conclusions.\n\nSummary: Dogs offer practical advantages for ageing research and share environments with humans, and cross-species epigenetic clocks bolster translational plausibility. Nonetheless, substantial breed structure and environmental heterogeneity, along with cohort selection effects, limit direct equivalence to human populations. The model is promising but requires explicit controls and cautious interpretation for human translation.\n\nClaim: C3\nOriginal: DAP's primary scientific aims span characterising ageing, large-scale genetics, multi-omics biomarkers, and an RCT of rapamycin (TRIAD).\nStatus: Verified\nConfidence: High\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n  - [Similar Paper] An open science study of ageing in companion dogs\n    Explicitly enumerates the four programme aims, including large-scale genetics, multi-omics biomarker development, and a randomised rapamycin trial.\n  - [Similar Paper] Test of Rapamycin in Aging Dogs (TRIAD): study design and rationale for a multicentre RCT\n    Independent, peer-reviewed design paper confirms a multicentre, double-masked, placebo-controlled, one-year, weekly low-dose rapamycin RCT with lifespan, healthspan, cardiac and cognitive endpoints and DSMB oversight.\n  - [Similar Paper] A randomised controlled trial to establish effects of short-term rapamycin in 24 middle-aged dogs\n    Pilot masked RCT establishes feasibility, safety monitoring, and echocardiography endpoints that inform TRIAD.\n  - [Patent] US11632938B2 - Markers for determining the biological age of a dog\n    Describes biomarker-based biological age estimation methods aligned with DAP's multi-omics biomarker aims.\n  - [Patent] WO2022272120A1 - Epigenetic clocks\n    Covers cross-species methylation clocks, directly relevant to DAP's biomarker pipelines and translational analyses.\n  - [Patent] WO2021124264A1 - Veterinary formulations comprising rapamycin and methods of using the same\n    Establishes veterinary dosing and formulation context for rapamycin, aligning with TRIAD's interventional domain.\n\nContradicting Evidence:\n  - [Similar Paper] A randomised controlled trial to establish effects of short-term rapamycin in 24 middle-aged dogs\n    Short-term trial shows safety and suggestive cardiac effects but does not establish lifespan extension, indicating that TRIAD's outcomes remain to be proven.\n\nSummary: The scope and design of DAP's aims, including the TRIAD RCT, are explicitly documented and independently confirmed by a dedicated design paper and prior pilot RCT. These sources verify the existence and methodological soundness of the programme aims, though they do not yet speak to efficacy outcomes. The claim concerns aims rather than results, and is therefore verified.\n\nClaim: C4\nOriginal: DAP has established scalable data collection, quality control, and participant engagement infrastructure.\nStatus: Verified\nConfidence: High\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n  - [Research Group] Cornell Veterinary Biobank\n    ISO-accredited biobank processes and distributes DAP biospecimens under governance and QC, evidencing scalable biospecimen infrastructure.\n  - [Similar Paper] An open science study of ageing in companion dogs\n    Describes HLES annual survey, targeted surveys, EMR ingestion, and REDCap-based operational workflows supporting large-scale data collection and QC.\n  - [Research Group] Dog Aging Project data access on Terra\n    Documents reproducible computational pipelines and platform-based data management for scalable analysis and sharing.\n  - [Similar Paper] Dog Aging Project End-of-Life Survey validation (JAVMA)\n    Provides instrument validation and demonstrates ongoing quality control for owner-reported measures.\n\nContradicting Evidence:\n  - [Similar Paper] Dog Aging Project End-of-Life Survey validation (JAVMA)\n    Notes the inherent limitations of owner-reported data despite validation, indicating residual measurement bias risk.\n\nSummary: Independent biobanking at Cornell and platform-based pipelines on Terra substantiate scalable collection and QC infrastructure. The Nature paper and instrument validation further confirm operational maturity, with acknowledged survey limitations managed through validation and QC. Overall, the infrastructure evidence is consistent and sufficient to verify the claim.\n\nClaim: C5\nOriginal: DAP commits to open science via data and biospecimen access.\nStatus: Partially Verified\nConfidence: Moderate\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n  - [Similar Paper] An open science study of ageing in companion dogs\n    States that de-identified datasets are available on Terra under a data use agreement, reflecting an open-science posture.\n  - [Research Group] Cornell Veterinary Biobank\n    Provides governed access to DAP biospecimens for qualified researchers with QC and return-of-data expectations.\n\nContradicting Evidence:\n  - [Similar Paper] An open science study of ageing in companion dogs\n    Data access is controlled via DUAs and platform accounts; some datasets and TRIAD outcomes are released post-completion, indicating conditional rather than fully open access.\n\nSummary: Clear mechanisms exist for data and biospecimen access that align with open-science practices, including governed distribution and de-identified datasets. Access is conditional and staged through DUAs and platform requirements, which is transparent but not fully open in the public-domain sense. The commitment is credible but not unrestricted, hence partially verified.\n\nClaim: C6\nOriginal: Ethical oversight and informed consent mirror human research standards and include animal-specific safeguards.\nStatus: Verified\nConfidence: High\n\nSupporting Evidence:\n  - [Research Group] Dog Aging Project Oversight & Compliance\n    Describes informed consent, IRB/IACUC approvals, and privacy policies for owner-participant and animal welfare protections.\n  - [Similar Paper] Test of Rapamycin in Aging Dogs (TRIAD): study design and rationale for a multicentre RCT\n    Specifies DSMB oversight, blinding, imaging cores, and prespecified endpoints, evidencing robust ethical and safety governance for the interventional trial.\n\nSummary: Human-style consent and oversight structures are documented alongside animal-specific safeguards, matching expectations for mixed human-animal research contexts. TRIAD's design includes a DSMB and rigorous masking and endpoint procedures, reinforcing the ethical framework. No material contradictions were identified.\n",
