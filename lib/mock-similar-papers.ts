    "text": "# Executive Summary  - The paper outlines the Dog Aging Project (DAP): \"a long-term longitudinal study of ageing in tens of thousands of companion dogs\" with open-data infrastructure and nested cohorts. Evidence strength: High for study design and infrastructure; Low-Moderate for anticipated outcomes because results are pending. (Abstract; Fig. 1a-c; pp. 2-5)   - Rationale: Companion dogs are proposed as a powerful model for human-relevant ageing due to shared environments, similar diseases, and faster ageing (approximately seven to ten times faster). Evidence strength: Moderate. (pp. 2-3)   - DAP aims: characterise multimorbidity, frailty, inflammageing; genotype ≥10,000 dogs; develop omics-based biomarkers; and run a randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled rapamycin trial. Evidence strength: Moderate for aims, Low for outcomes. (pp. 4-6; Fig. 3; Table 1)   - Cohorts and scale: >30,000 dogs enrolled; USA-wide; five overlapping cohorts (Pack, Foundation, Precision, TRIAD, Centenarian). Evidence strength: High. (pp. 2-5; Fig. 1a-c)   - Data: comprehensive annual owner surveys, veterinary EMR extraction, biospecimens, low-pass WGS, environmental linkages. Evidence strength: High for plans and early operations. (pp. 4-6; Fig. 3; Table 1)   - Open science: de-identified data via Terra and biospecimens via a Cornell-hosted Biobank; first release planned Q1 2022. Evidence strength: High for commitment. (p. 7)   - Ethics/operations: IACUC approvals; informed consent; advisory boards; strong owner engagement. Evidence strength: High for governance. (pp. 6-7; p. 8)   - Key limitations: largely prospective; US-only; potential selection bias toward regularly vetted dogs; heavy reliance on owner report. (pp. 3-5; Table 1)  ---  # Key Claims and Evidence  **C1. DAP is a large, open-data, long-term longitudinal study of companion-dog ageing with nested cohorts.**   - **Evidence summary:** Programme description with five cohorts: Pack, Foundation, Precision, TRIAD (rapamycin RCT), and Centenarian; >30,000 participants; USA-wide; lifetime follow-up. (Abstract; Fig. 1a-c; pp. 2-5)   - **Key numbers:** >30,000 dogs; one dog per household; all 50 US states; Centenarian = top 0.1% of size-specific age distribution. (pp. 2-5; Fig. 1a-c)   - **Source location:** Abstract; pp. 2-5; Fig. 1a-c.   - **Strength:** **High** (descriptive).  **C2. Companion dogs are a suitable and socially relevant model for ageing research.**   - **Evidence summary:** Dogs vary widely in phenotype and lifespan, share human environments and healthcare, experience human-like age-related diseases, and age ~7-10× faster, enabling feasible longitudinal and interventional studies. (pp. 2-3)   - **Key quote:** \"Companion dogs experience nearly every functional decline and disease of ageing that people do\" (≤30 words). (p. 2)   - **Source location:** pp. 2-3.   - **Strength:** **Moderate** (rationale-based).  **C3. Primary scientific aims include defining normative canine ageing and mapping genetic architecture using ≥10,000 low-pass WGS genomes.**   - **Evidence summary:** Aim (1) multimorbidity, frailty, inflammageing; Aim (2) ≥10,000 dogs genotyped with imputation; on track to 10,000 genomes by end of 2022. (pp. 4-6)   - **Key numbers:** ≥10,000 WGS (low-pass); size-stratified analyses. (pp. 4-6; Fig. 3a)   - **Source location:** pp. 4-6; Fig. 3a.   - **Strength:** **Moderate** for aims; **Low** for outcomes (prospective).  **C4. Annual multi-omic profiling (metabolome, epigenome, microbiome) in Precision and TRIAD will support biomarker development.**   - **Evidence summary:** Biospecimen kits with blood, plasma/serum, urine, hair, faeces; clinicopathology; accelerometry; processing pipelines and QA/QC described. (pp. 4-6; Fig. 3a; Table 1)   - **Key numbers:** Precision n = 1,000; TRIAD n = 350; sample panels include inflammatory cytokines, lipoprotein profile, plasma metabolome, faecal microbiome. (Fig. 3a; Table 1)   - **Source location:** Fig. 3a; Table 1; pp. 4-6.   - **Strength:** **Moderate** for feasibility; **Low** for biomarker validity (pending).  **C5. The TRIAD trial will test whether one year of weekly low-dose rapamycin improves lifespan and healthspan in large-breed, middle-aged dogs.**   - **Evidence summary:** Randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial; endpoints include lifespan, heart and cognitive function, age-related disease incidence; enrolment began 06/2021. (pp. 5-6)   - **Key numbers:** TRIAD n = 350; seven US veterinary teaching hospitals; one-year course, weekly low dose. (pp. 5-6; Fig. 3a; Table 1)   - **Source location:** pp. 5-6; Fig. 3a; Table 1.   - **Strength:** **Low** (no results yet, though design is strong).  **C6. DAP commits to open science through public data releases and a Biobank.**   - **Evidence summary:** De-identified data on Terra; access via data use agreement; subset of biospecimens banked at Cornell and available to qualified researchers; return-of-data requirement. (p. 7)   - **Key numbers:** First public data release scheduled Q1 2022. (p. 7)   - **Source location:** p. 7.   - **Strength:** **High** (policy commitment and infrastructure).  **C7. Robust ethics, governance, and participant engagement underpin study feasibility and retention.**   - **Evidence summary:** IACUC approvals (AUPs 2018-0401 CAM; 2018-0368 CAM); informed consent; advisory boards including animal welfare and paediatric bioethics; newsletter >85,000 recipients; ~20,000 helpdesk enquiries resolved in 2020; private \"Dog Park\" community.

(pp. 3-4, 6)   - **Source location:** pp. 3-4, 6-8.   - **Strength:** **Moderate-High** (operations documented).  ---  # Gaps & Limitations  - **Prospective outcomes pending (C3-C5):** Most claims about biomarkers, genetic architecture, and rapamycin effects are anticipatory; no efficacy data provided. (pp. 5-7)   - **External validity (C1-C2):** Current participation is US-only; one dog per household; may limit generalisability. (p. 3; Fig. 1b)   - **Selection bias (C1):** Sampled cohorts require qualifying veterinary EMRs; authors note possible bias toward regularly vetted dogs. (p. 4)   - **Measurement bias (C1, C4):** Heavy reliance on owner-reported surveys; although reproducibility piloted, detailed metrics not reported. [DETAIL NEEDED]. (pp. 4-5; Table 1)   - **Missing data/analysis plans (C3-C4):** Statistical analysis plans, handling of missingness, multiplicity controls not detailed.

        "The paper outlines the Dog Aging Project (DAP): \"a long-term longitudinal study of ageing in tens of thousands of companion dogs\" with open-data infrastructure and nested cohorts. Evidence strength: High for study design and infrastructure; Low-Moderate for anticipated outcomes because results are pending. (Abstract; Fig. 1a-c; pp. 2-5)",
        "Rationale: Companion dogs are proposed as a powerful model for human-relevant ageing due to shared environments, similar diseases, and faster ageing (approximately seven to ten times faster). Evidence strength: Moderate. (pp. 2-3)",
        "DAP aims: characterise multimorbidity, frailty, inflammageing; genotype ≥10,000 dogs; develop omics-based biomarkers; and run a randomised, double-masked, placebo-controlled rapamycin trial. Evidence strength: Moderate for aims, Low for outcomes. (pp. 4-6; Fig. 3; Table 1)",
        "Cohorts and scale: >30,000 dogs enrolled; USA-wide; five overlapping cohorts (Pack, Foundation, Precision, TRIAD, Centenarian). Evidence strength: High. (pp. 2-5; Fig. 1a-c)",
        "Data: comprehensive annual owner surveys, veterinary EMR extraction, biospecimens, low-pass WGS, environmental linkages. Evidence strength: High for plans and early operations. (pp. 4-6; Fig. 3; Table 1)",
        "Open science: de-identified data via Terra and biospecimens via a Cornell-hosted Biobank; first release planned Q1 2022. Evidence strength: High for commitment. (p. 7)",
        "Ethics/operations: IACUC approvals; informed consent; advisory boards; strong owner engagement. Evidence strength: High for governance. (pp. 6-7; p. 8)",
        "Key limitations: largely prospective; US-only; potential selection bias toward regularly vetted dogs; heavy reliance on owner report. (pp. 3-5; Table 1)"
