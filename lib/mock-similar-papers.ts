It emphasises method toolkits that connect structure to function, including imaging, isotopic tracing and field-to-lab sampling pipelines.  - Key method signals:   - Use X-ray micro-CT to quantify aggregate size, pore size classes and connectivity.   - Map enzyme activity near pores with quantitative soil zymography overlays.   - Couple 13C or 15N tracers with SIP and sequencing to assign metabolisms to habitats.   - Measure CO2, CH4 and N2O with chambers or cores plus isotopocule/isotope partitioning.   - Compare management contrasts (tillage, cover crops, compaction) using intact-core microcosms. - Search queries:   soil micro-CT pore network microbiome agroecosystems     soil pore architecture zymography 13C 15N SIP     cover crop tillage pore connectivity N2O micro-CT     compaction X-ray microtomography gas diffusivity soil cores     soil carbon stabilisation enzyme zymography pore size  Similar Papers (3-5 entries): 1.

Where a PDF was present, I linked it directly; otherwise I linked the official record page.  - For Paper 4 and parts of 5-6, PURE/ETD indexing and embargoes likely hide the most recent theses; team pages confirm active PhD pipelines even when a final thesis is not yet posted.   If you want, I can keep digging on the AU and UTK/MU repositories to replace the placeholder rows with confirmed theses, and add any new items I find."
