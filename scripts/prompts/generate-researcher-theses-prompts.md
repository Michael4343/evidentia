Compile PhD Theses from Research Groups of Paper Authors

Goal: For each paper below, surface PhD theses that validate the research groups' expertise and connect directly to the paper's author teams.
Work sequentially: paper → authors → research groups → thesis evidence.

Methodology:
1. Map every author and their active research group(s) at the time of publication. Use the listed groups as starting points and expand to co-affiliations when needed.
2. For each group, search for PhD theses published within ±5 years of the paper's publication year. Prioritise official repositories (institutional libraries, national theses portals, ProQuest, HAL, ETH Research Collection, etc.).
3. Rank theses by closeness to authors: lead author groups first, then co-author groups following author order. If the thesis author is also on the paper, mark that explicitly.
4. Record whether the thesis or underlying datasets are publicly accessible. Capture the exact URL to the repository or PDF when it exists; otherwise note the access route (embargo, request required, etc.).
5. Keep notes concise, cite concrete URLs, and flag gaps where information cannot be verified after diligent searching.

Deliverable:
- Return plain text with one Markdown table per paper using these exact columns (in order):
  | Thesis title | Thesis author | Research group | Year | Associated paper author | Author position | Relevance ranking | Data availability | Data access link |
- Sort each table by relevance (1 = highest).
- After each table, add a short bullet list (≤3 bullets) noting key sources checked and any missing data that needs follow-up.

Per-paper section (repeat for each paper):
Paper: {PAPER_TITLE}
Publication year: {YEAR}
DOI: {DOI}    [or]    Identifier: {IDENTIFIER}
Authors (listed order): {AUTHORS}

Known research groups to start from:
- {GROUP_NAME} — Institution: {INSTITUTION}
  Website: {WEBSITE}
  Focus: {GROUP_NOTES}
  Contacts: {CONTACTS}  # e.g., Name | Role | Email; Name | Role | Email

Checklist:
- Verify additional groups for any authors not covered by the list above.
- Capture thesis titles verbatim; include repository identifiers (handle, DOI) when available.
- Note if no qualifying thesis exists and explain why (e.g., MSc only, thesis unpublished, author still a candidate).

## Cleanup prompt — header
Give this to a cleanup agent, then paste the analyst notes beneath the divider and request strict JSON only.

```text
You are a cleanup agent. Convert the analyst's notes into strict JSON for Evidentia's researcher thesis UI.

Output requirements:
- Return a single JSON object with keys: researchers (array), promptNotes (optional string).
- Each researcher object must include: name (string), email (string|null), group (string|null),
  latest_publication (object with title (string|null), year (number|null), venue (string|null), url (string|null)),
  phd_thesis (null or object with title (string|null), year (number|null), institution (string|null), url (string|null)),
  data_publicly_available ("yes" | "no" | "unknown").
- Use null for unknown scalars. Use lowercase for data_publicly_available values.
- Every url field must be a direct https:// link. If the notes provide a markdown link or reference-style footnote, extract the underlying URL and place it in the url field. Never leave a url blank when the notes include a working link.
- For phd_thesis.url, copy the repository/download link from the analyst notes' "Data access link" column; if multiple are provided, prefer the PDF/download URL. Only set null when no link is given or it is explicitly unavailable.
- No markdown, commentary, or trailing prose. Valid JSON only (double quotes).
- Preserve factual content from the notes; do not invent new theses or publications.
Before responding, you must paste the analyst notes after these instructions so you can structure them. Use them verbatim; do not add new facts.
