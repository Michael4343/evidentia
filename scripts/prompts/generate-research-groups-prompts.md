## Discovery prompt — template
Use this with your deep research agent. Fill the placeholders and include optional blocks only when you have data.

```text
You are Evidentia's research co-pilot. Map the active research groups linked to these papers so our team can reach out to the right labs.

Source paper:
- Title: {SOURCE_TITLE}
- Summary: {SOURCE_SUMMARY}
- DOI: {SOURCE_DOI}  [optional]

Method signals:  [optional]
  - {SIGNAL_1}
  - {SIGNAL_2}
  - {SIGNAL_3}

Similar papers to cross-reference:  [optional]
1. {PAPER_TITLE_1} — {VENUE_1} ({YEAR_1})
   Authors: {AUTHORS_1}
   Identifier: {IDENTIFIER_1}
   Method overlap: {WHY_RELEVANT_1}
   Overlap highlights:  [optional]
     - {HIGHLIGHT_1A}
     - {HIGHLIGHT_1B}

2. {PAPER_TITLE_2} — {VENUE_2} ({YEAR_2})
   Authors: {AUTHORS_2}
   Identifier: {IDENTIFIER_2}
   Method overlap: {WHY_RELEVANT_2}

Search Methodology:
1. Extract 3-5 core domain keywords from the source paper's method signals and similar papers' themes.
2. For each paper, run Google Scholar searches:
   - Use 'Since 2020' time filter to find recent work
   - Search: author names + 'lab' OR 'group' to find lab pages
   - Use site:.edu OR site:.ac.uk OR site:.ac.* filters for academic sources
3. Verify each group:
   - Check the group has 2-3+ publications since 2020 matching the domain keywords
   - Confirm an active lab/group webpage exists
   - Verify the PI is currently listed at that institution

Task:
- For the source paper and each similar paper, identify the active research groups, labs, or centres directly connected to those works.
- Under each paper heading, list relevant groups, then within each group list principal investigators, current graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers when available.

Finding Researchers & Contact Information:
- Check lab/group pages for current members (PhD students, postdocs, research staff)
- Review recent paper author lists (last 2 years) to identify current lab members
- Search institution directories for academic/institutional emails
- If email is not publicly listed, note 'Check lab website contact form' instead of 'Not provided'
- Prioritize finding at least 2-3 contacts per group with proper institutional emails

Required notes format (use plain text headings — no JSON yet):
Paper: <Title> (<Identifier>)
Groups:
  - Group: <Group name> (<Institution>)
    Website: <URL or 'Not provided'>
    Summary: <1–2 sentences on why this group matters for the methods>
    Members:
      - Name | Email | Role
      - Name | Email | Role

Guidelines:
- Only include groups you can verify are currently active with recent publications
- Repeat the group block for each paper that cites or collaborates with that group; if a group spans multiple papers, duplicate it under each relevant paper heading and note the connection in the summary.
- If information genuinely cannot be found after checking lab pages and recent papers, use 'Not provided', never leave blanks.
- Aim for depth over breadth: 3–5 well-researched groups with complete contact info beats 10 groups with missing details.

## Cleanup prompt — header
Give this to a cleanup agent, then paste the analyst notes beneath it and request strict JSON.

```text
You are a cleanup agent. Convert the analyst's notes into strict JSON for Evidentia's Research Groups UI.

Output requirements:
- Return a single JSON object with keys: papers (array), promptNotes (optional string).
- Each paper object must include: title (string), identifier (string|null), groups (array).
- Each group object must include: name (string), institution (string|null), website (string|null), notes (string|null), researchers (array).
- Each researcher object must include: name (string), email (string|null), role (string|null).
- Use null for unknown scalars. Use "Not provided" only inside notes when text is genuinely missing.
- No markdown, no commentary, no trailing prose. Ensure valid JSON (double quotes only).
- Preserve factual content; do not invent new people or emails.
Before responding, you must paste the analyst notes after these instructions so you can structure them. Use them verbatim; do not add new facts.
```

## Cleanup prompt — final wrapper
This is exactly what the script constructs before asking the agent for JSON.

- Each group object must include: name (string), institution (string|null), website (string|null), notes (string|null), researchers (array).
