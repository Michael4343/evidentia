=== VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY ===

CRITICAL STANCE: Be skeptical and rigorous. Assume claims are UNVERIFIED until proven otherwise.
Default to 'Partially Verified' - most claims should have caveats. 'Verified' status is RARE.

For each claim (C1, C2, etc.):

1. INDEPENDENCE CHECK:
   - Evidence from the SAME research group or authors = NOT independent validation
   - Require 3+ INDEPENDENT sources (different groups/institutions) for 'Verified' status
   - Same-group evidence can only support 'Partially Verified' at best

2. DATA AVAILABILITY CHECK:
   - Is raw data publicly available? (GitHub, Zenodo, institutional repository)
   - Is code/analysis pipeline shared?
   - Can findings be reproduced by an independent researcher?
   - NO public data/code = automatic downgrade from 'Verified' to 'Partially Verified'

3. STATISTICAL RIGOR CHECK:
   - Adequate sample size (N)?
   - Proper controls and randomization?
   - P-values reported and appropriate?
   - Effect sizes meaningful?
   - Missing any of these = note as limitation

4. REPLICATION CHECK:
   - Has the finding been replicated by another group?
   - Do similar papers CONFIRM or CONTRADICT?
   - Are methods validated across multiple studies?
   - No independent replication = 'Partially Verified' at best

5. METHODOLOGICAL SOUNDNESS:
   - Appropriate study design for the claim?
   - Potential confounders addressed?
   - Limitations acknowledged?
   - Look for gaps in reasoning or methodology

6. CONTRADICTION SEARCH (CRITICAL):
   - Actively look for contradicting evidence
   - Check if similar papers show different results
   - Note any inconsistencies in methods or findings
   - Patents showing prior art = potential contradiction
   - If ANY contradictions found, cannot be 'Verified'

7. VERIFICATION STATUS ASSIGNMENT (STRICT CRITERIA):

   ✅ VERIFIED (RARE - only if ALL criteria met):
      • 3+ independent sources confirm the claim
      • NO contradicting evidence
      • Data AND code publicly available
      • Methods replicated by other groups
      • Statistical rigor confirmed (adequate N, controls, p-values)
      • No significant methodological limitations

   ⚠️  PARTIALLY VERIFIED (MOST COMMON - default for reasonable claims):
      • 1-2 supporting sources (may include same group)
      • Minor contradictions, gaps, or limitations present
      • Limited or no data availability
      • Not independently replicated yet
      • Some methodological concerns
      • Evidence suggests claim is directionally correct but needs more validation

   ❌ CONTRADICTED:
      • Evidence actively refutes the claim
      • Replication attempts failed
      • Statistical or methodological flaws identified
      • Contradicting papers outnumber supporting ones

   ❓ INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE:
      • Less than 1 supporting source
      • No independent validation available
      • Missing key information needed to verify
      • Claim is too vague to verify against available evidence

8. CONFIDENCE LEVEL ASSIGNMENT:
   - High: Only for 'Verified' claims with overwhelming evidence
   - Moderate: For 'Partially Verified' with reasonable support
   - Low: For 'Partially Verified' with minimal support or 'Insufficient Evidence'

9. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION:
   - List ALL supporting evidence with specific relevance notes
   - List ALL contradicting evidence (actively search for these)
   - Be specific about what each source contributes

10. VERIFICATION SUMMARY:
    - 2-3 sentences explaining status and reasoning
    - Explicitly state limitations or caveats
    - Note what additional evidence would strengthen verification

IMPORTANT: Most claims should be 'Partially Verified'. If you mark everything as 'Verified', you are NOT being critical enough.

=== DELIVERABLE ===

For each claim, provide:
- Claim ID (C1, C2, etc.)
- Original Claim (verbatim)
- Verification Status (Verified/Partially Verified/Contradicted/Insufficient Evidence)
- Supporting Evidence:
  * Source type (Similar Paper/Patent/Research Group/Thesis)
  * Title/identifier
  * Brief relevance note (how it supports)
- Contradicting Evidence (if any):
  * Source type
  * Title/identifier
  * Brief relevance note (how it contradicts)
- Verification Summary (2-3 sentences explaining status and reasoning)
- Confidence Level (High/Moderate/Low)

Also provide:
- Overall Assessment: Brief paragraph on the paper's overall claim validity

## Cleanup prompt — header
Give this to a cleanup agent, then paste the analyst notes beneath the divider and request strict JSON.

```text
You are a cleanup agent. Convert the analyst's claim verification notes into strict JSON for Evidentia's verified claims UI.

Output requirements:
- Return a single JSON object with keys: claims (array), overallAssessment (string), promptNotes (optional string).
- Each claim object must include: claimId (string matching C1, C2, etc.), originalClaim (string), verificationStatus (string), supportingEvidence (array), contradictingEvidence (array), verificationSummary (string), confidenceLevel (string).
- verificationStatus must be one of: "Verified", "Partially Verified", "Contradicted", "Insufficient Evidence".
- confidenceLevel must be one of: "High", "Moderate", "Low".
- Each evidence item (supporting or contradicting) must have: source (string: "Similar Paper", "Patent", "Research Group", or "Thesis"), title (string), relevance (string explaining the connection).
- verificationSummary must be a detailed 2-3 sentence explanation of the verification status and reasoning.
- overallAssessment should be a brief paragraph summarizing the paper's overall claim validity across all claims.
