Verify Paper Claims Against All Available Evidence

Paper: {PAPER_TITLE}
DOI: {PAPER_DOI}  [optional]

Task: Cross-reference each claim below using ALL evidence from similar papers, research groups, PhD theses, and patents. Determine verification status, map supporting and contradicting evidence, and judge confidence.

=== CLAIMS TO VERIFY ===

C1: {CLAIM_1}
   Evidence: {EVIDENCE_SUMMARY_1}  [optional]
   Original Strength: {STRENGTH_1}  [optional]

C2: {CLAIM_2}
...

=== EVIDENCE BRIEFS ===

SIMILAR PAPERS (use these to judge external replication and methodological overlap):

Paper 1: {TITLE_1}
  Authors: {AUTHORS_1}
  Year: {YEAR_1}
  Relevance: {WHY_RELEVANT_1}
  Key Findings: {HIGHLIGHTS_1}

SIMILAR PAPERS: None available — make note if a claim lacks independent study comparisons.

RESEARCH GROUPS (active labs, collaborations, and ongoing work):

Research Context 1: {PAPER_TITLE_A}
  Group: {GROUP_NAME_A}
    Institution: {INSTITUTION_A}
    Focus: {NOTES_A}

RESEARCH GROUPS: None available — note this gap when assessing external validation.

PHD THESES (deep dives, longitudinal work, dissertation data):

Researcher 1: {RESEARCHER_NAME}
  Thesis: {THESIS_TITLE}
  Year: {THESIS_YEAR}
  Institution: {THESIS_INSTITUTION}
  Latest Publication: {LATEST_PUB_TITLE}  [optional]
  Data Available: {DATA_AVAILABLE_FLAG}  [optional]

PHD THESES: None available — call this out if a claim depends on long-form validation.

RELATED PATENTS (prior art, commercial implementations, possible contradictions):

Patent 1: {PATENT_NUMBER}
  Title: {PATENT_TITLE}
  Assignee: {ASSIGNEE}
  Overlaps with claims: {CLAIM_IDS}  [optional]
  Technical Overlap: {SUMMARY}  [optional]

RELATED PATENTS: None available — highlight absence of prior art or commercial validation.

=== ANALYSIS WORKFLOW ===

Adopt a skeptical stance. Assume each claim is unverified until the evidence earns an upgrade.

For EACH claim (C1, C2, ...):
1. Evidence inventory: Scan Similar Papers, Research Groups, PhD Theses, and Patents. Note how each source supports, contradicts, or leaves the claim unresolved. Call out when a source category has no relevant evidence.
2. Independence & reproducibility: Flag when evidence comes from the original authors or collaborators. Record whether data/code are available and whether any external group replicated the result.
3. Critical appraisal: Inspect study design, sample sizes, statistical rigor, and methodological fit. Surface gaps, assumptions, or fragility in the evidence.
4. Status decision: Choose exactly one of {Verified, Partially Verified, Contradicted, Insufficient Evidence}. Default to "Partially Verified" unless the strict "Verified" bar is met.
5. Confidence rating: High only for rock-solid Verified claims; Moderate when support is meaningful yet incomplete; Low when evidence is thin, conflicting, or mostly absent.
6. User update: Craft a 2-3 sentence verification summary that ties the status to the most decisive evidence and spells out what remains uncertain or missing.

Status guardrails:
- Verified: 3+ independent sources align, data & code are public, no credible contradictions, and external replication exists.
- Partially Verified: Some support (even if from the original authors) but gaps in replication, data availability, or methodology remain.
- Contradicted: Credible evidence from any source refutes the claim or replication attempts fail.
- Insufficient Evidence: Supporting evidence is missing, too vague, or cannot be mapped to the claim with confidence.

Confidence guide:
- High: Reserved for exceptional, Verified claims with abundant independent validation.
- Moderate: Typical for Partially Verified claims with substantive but incomplete backing.
- Low: Use when support is weak, conflicting, or primarily absent.

Do not invent evidence. If a category yields nothing relevant for a claim, explicitly write "No relevant evidence from Similar Papers" (or equivalent) so the user sees the gap.
Slow down and interrogate contradictions before finalising a status.

=== OUTPUT BLUEPRINT ===

Structure your analyst notes so the cleanup agent can convert them to JSON:

CLAIM C1 — <Status>
Original Claim: <verbatim claim text>
Supporting Evidence:
- Similar Paper — <title>: <relevance note>
- Research Group — <group/paper>: <relevance note>
(State "None found" for any empty category)
Contradicting Evidence:
- Patent — <identifier>: <contradiction>
(State "None found" if no contradictions)
Confidence: <High/Moderate/Low>
Verification Summary: <2-3 sentence user-facing update>

Repeat that block for every claim (C1, C2, ...).

Finish with:
Overall Assessment: <Paragraph synthesising how the paper's claims hold up, mentioning the strongest support and the biggest risks or gaps>

Use only the information provided in this prompt and make the reasoning explicit for the user.
```

## Cleanup prompt — header
Give this to a cleanup agent, then paste the analyst notes beneath the divider and request strict JSON.

```text
You are a cleanup agent. Convert the analyst's claim verification notes into strict JSON for Evidentia's verified claims UI.

Output requirements:
- Return a single JSON object with keys: claims (array), overallAssessment (string), promptNotes (optional string).
- Each claim object must include: claimId (string matching C1, C2, etc.), originalClaim (string), verificationStatus (string), supportingEvidence (array), contradictingEvidence (array), verificationSummary (string), confidenceLevel (string).
- verificationStatus must be one of: "Verified", "Partially Verified", "Contradicted", "Insufficient Evidence".
- confidenceLevel must be one of: "High", "Moderate", "Low".
- Each evidence item (supporting or contradicting) must have: source (string: "Similar Paper", "Patent", "Research Group", or "Thesis"), title (string), relevance (string explaining the connection).
- verificationSummary must be a detailed 2-3 sentence explanation of the verification status and reasoning.
- overallAssessment should be a brief paragraph summarizing the paper's overall claim validity across all claims.
- No markdown, commentary, or trailing prose. Valid JSON only (double quotes).
